I successfully completed FreeCodeCampâ€™s Responsive Web Design certification, gaining hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and accessibility best practices. 
Throughout the program, I built multiple projects, including a tribute page, a technical documentation page, a product landing page, a personal portfolio 
website, and a survey form. These projects reinforced my ability to create structured, visually appealing, and mobile-friendly web pages while implementing responsive design principles.
